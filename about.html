<p><img src="img/profPic.jpg" class="floatLeft"></img>I'm Utah-based Game Developer and student. I taught myself C++ when I was 12, and have been making games ever since. I'm currently working towards a BS in Computer Science with an emphasis on game development at the University of Utah (Ranked #1 game program in the US). My dream is to work on unique and awesome games.
