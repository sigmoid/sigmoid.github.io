    <h1>about tightrope</h1>

    <p>Hi there! If you're reading this, I hope you've played my game, Tightrope, and I hope you found it interesting. 
    If you haven't played it yet, I would encourage you to do so before reading the rest of this. 
    I think it's better to go into the game cold without knowing too much about the backstory. 
    Also if you're not familiar with the game some of
    what I'm going to say here won't make any sense.</p>

    <h2>who am i</h2>

    <p>I'm Adam. If you were a stranger I would probably tell you that I'm a software engineer, but if you were
    someone who I trusted a bit more I'd tell you that I'm a game developer. Both are equally true. I work
    as a software engineer for a living, and all of the other time in my life is consumed by game development.
    Despite being incredibly passionate about making games and proud of the things I've made, I don't really talk about it.
    I think people have preconceived notions of game developers. I worry that people might think I am a child
    in a man's body who doesn't think very critically about things and is still interested in flashy distracting toys.
    I know that I am not that person. I know that game development is actually an interesting artistic medium that is capable of much more than 
    the mainstream perception, but they might not know that. That scares me. I have been scared for years to tell people certain things 
    about myself because I know they may react poorly (from lived experience). So when I learned something about myself in 2018 that derailed 
    my life and had incredibly scary implications for my future I did what I thought was safe.
    I just hid it. I didn't talk about it with my friends, my family, and even worse I didn't
    talk about it with myself. A couple of years later I finally feel like I want to stop hiding it. I want to talk to people about it.
    In early 2018 I suffered a total mental breakdown which involved spending 23 days in a psychiatric hospital.
    I was anxious, delusional, terrified, and over a thousand miles away from my family. That's what Tightrope is about. It is my attempt to use 
    game mechanics to convey how it felt to lose control, and to use narrative to relay what happened.    
    </p>

    <h2>the story</h2>

    <p>
      I attended the University of Utah which is just a hair above a thousand miles away from where I grew up. It was
      a pretty insane thing for me to do. There were plenty of good college options a short drive away from home which would
      have been cheaper than going out of state, but I was dead set on going to a school with a good games program. The money also wasn't
      really a big factor. I had scholarships and my grandfather had left all of us grandkids money to pay for school. I was also 
      eager for a fresh start. I had started seeing a therapist my junior year of high school and through that developed a much better level
      of self confidence. I felt ready to meet new people and maybe reinvent myself free from the reputation I had earned as a weird loner
      who seems pretty smart because he knows how to code.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The first year flew by. I went to class, got good grades, met new people, and even started doing things that I would have 
      never done in high school like going to parties and drinking with friends. I tried to join the game development club, but learned that it
      practically didn't exist. I participated in a game jam on the internet where the top 5 entries won
      a free Game Developers Conference pass and a space to demo your game for a couple of hours. To my surprise, I actually ended up getting 4th place. Things were 
      going as well as they could. Reflecting on this time I realize I was actually pretty damn happy for once in my life. That summer I shared a dorm with what would become my closest friend, 
      and spent much of our days skating down campus like it was a ski slope and riding the train back to the top.
    </p>
<br/>
    <p>
      I glided into the next year with extreme excitement. I got to live in a fancy new dorm for entrepenuers and met some very cool people that way. I don't consider myself 
      an entrepenuer and didn't really think I was then either. I just wanted to live in a cool building and to be part of an exclusive club. One day, I noticed that there was 
      a group of people meeting in the lobby. I recognized some of them from class and curiously walked over to them. This was the first meeting of the resurrected Gamecraft club, the one that I 
      wanted to join the year before. It had new leadership and seemed to be attracting a good crowd. I would spend this semester getting to know those members and ultimately end up 
      as vice president. It was incredibly fun. I am still incredibly proud of the work we did to grow this club into a thriving community that still exists today, even if I was only a small part of it. 
      Classes were orders of magnitude harder. We started learning actual computer science at this point.
      We learned things like: how computer hardware works, how to write software in a team setting, how to write code that deals with networking, how to write proofs. It was all fascinating, but 
      I started to notice anxiety creeping in. During my software practice class, I made a joke to my friend about employing 
      Keynesian spending in his stress economy. My theory was this: stress is like money. It seems really important and there seems like there should be a limit to how far down you can go, but also like currency
      it's really just a made up thing that you can manipulate to your advantage. In the same way that you can have a national debt, you can have a debt for your stress. So I encouraged him to do what I do. To never worry about taking on more stress. 
      I said this as a joke, but in my head I meant it. I thought that my stress was already at a maximum and no amount of additional obligations could do any damage. Before going further, I want to point out that this is an incredibly
      dangerous, stupid, and wrong idea. You will see why soon. I was still doing well in school, but I was constantly on the edge.  For a final project at the end of the first semester, my friend from software practice and I wrote an entire google sheets clone in a couple of weeks. I focused on writing the server 
      while my friend worked on the client. I spent entire days in the lab, arriving at dawn and staying deep into the night all while pounding coffee, sneaking off for hits of niccotine, and eating whatever I could find in the engineering building 
      just to keep going. I made it through the year giving and receiving a generous amount of help, but I 
      neglected my career. I hadn't applied to any internships for that summer. This was due to a few factors. I didn't think I actually wanted to work at a game studio or a software company. I wanted to be 
      an independent game developer. I also didn't realize the value and importance of doing internships. I was terrified at the prospect of doing a coding interview, and even scared of the 
      pressure of working at a tech company. I spent the summer with the same roommate from my freshman summer. We rented an apartment, skated some more, and I took a few more classes. All in all, it 
      wasn't a bad year.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Then the third year happened. It started off as a pretty logical continuation of the second. Classes were a bit more difficult and I was still helping manage Gamecraft's monthly jams which involved frequently staying up past 4am to
      make games after hours in the lab of the games department, and then cleaning up after ourselves.  This year, I decided to apply to some internships. I had good grades, had developed a bit of an ego for being a "good programmer," and I wanted to give professional game development a shot. I applied to just a few huge game studios. 
      Then, on my 21st birthday, I had a final for my linear algebra class in the evening. The sun went down behind my back as I struggled through an incredibly long test that most students would later confess they didn't 
      finish in time. I turned on my phone after turning in the exam. I walked out of the building towards my apartment in the dark as I scrolled through the notifications. I noticed an email from the one studio I applied to that actually excited me.
      My heart raced as I opened the email to read "After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that..." I was devastated. I stopped by a gas station on the way home and bought my first legal drink, a large IPA style beer that had practically no 
      alcoohol in it in accordance with Utah laws. I was in a somewhat dark place. It hurt so much more than the negative comments I had read on my games in the past. It was a company that specializes in making games telling me "you're not good enough."
       As I drank my terrible beer (I hate IPAs), I brainstormed ways that I could make my next application stronger. They must have not been impressed by my games. I needed to make something huge, complicated, and 
      mainstream enough to impress them. I needed to double the amount of time I spent on my personal projects. Between school and Gamecraft, I thought I could do it. 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      I returned the next semester on fire. Inspired to make something huge, I recruited a former collaborator to make our magnum opus. We released a game a few years prior that was played by Markiplier. It was more success than I thought 
      I was capable of at the time, but I wanted to go bigger. I began to plan my days and budget my time.
      Go to class for a few hours a day, finish homework in the afternoon, spend 4 hours making games at night. My scheduled didn't account for sleep. I budgeted maybe 5 hours a night. The game started to take shape. You played as an astronaut on the first 
      colony on Mars, but you were alone. You spent the duration of the game painting landscapes of the planet which revealed memories of what happened there. It had a lot of potential and it's a shame that we never got to finish it. We still talk about coming back to
      it. All the while I was keeping up in school, making good progress on the game, and still had time to go to Gamecraft. The lack of sleep didn't bother me much. Just like stress, it was a factor that I could manipulate to be more productive. I started to cut back on sleep. I don't remember the exact number but 
      suffice it to say it was quite a bit less than 5 hours, which is already unhealthy. At this point, a friend reached out to me with an opportunity. A professor that I admired was looking for a TA. For those who aren't familiar, a TA or Teaching Assistant 
      is a student who helps a professor grade assignments and provides support to the students. It's just a job and something to put on your resume. I didn't hesitate. I immediately rode the train to campus, sat through his class, and approached him after to apply.
      We spent some time in his office after that where he did a cursory check to make sure I am a good student, that I remember the concepts from his class, and could devote 14 hours a week to this job. He remembered my name, and that I got an A in his class, and he 
      was impressed by my GPA and the fact that I sought him out. I had the job. It never occurred to me that I really didn't have time for the job. I was still in the mindset that nothing I had been doing in my life up to that point was good enough, and I needed 
      to do much more to get a job. During this time, one of the other companies that I had applied to reached out to schedule an interview over the phone. The interview programming problem was an absolute lay-up. At the time, I thought the interview went fairly well. In retrospect I think it was a red flag.
      I did the problem backwards. I started by describing a relatively complicated solution that happened to be one of the better ways to solve the problem, but when the interviewer asked me to write the more obvious, slower version of the algorithm so we could compare them, I couldn't do it.
      To be clear, it was a very easy programming problem and it was not impressive that I was able to figure out the more complicated solution. What was odd was that I was <em>only</em> able to figure that one out. I couldn't slow down my thoughts to work through the steps of the other method.
      My brain would oscillate between different versions of the same problem and I couldn't keep it all straight. This is where Tightrope begins. Shortly after my interview where I believe my actual ability to reason began to decline.

      If you read on, the story of the game will be spoiled, and I want to urge you again to play it if you haven't. While this post contains a lot of the information that you might want to know about this story, it is unable to make you feel something in the same way that game can.
      Life went on after the interview. I kept working way too hard and, over time, I decreased the amount that I would sleep every night even further. At this point sleep was nothing but an obligation. My life felt like building a skyscraper where my health is the base, and my responsibilities 
      and goals were the stories. I was adding new floors every week. Projects, new features to the game, offering to do more TA work. It didn't matter. No matter how high I went I thought this building is safe. No earthquake could bring it down.
      I didn't realize that the once perfectly stable base was eroding, fast. My anxiety got much worse. I started noticing tunnel vision, feeling like I was outside of my own body, and it was always set off by the most mundane things. That is, if there was even a cause in the first place.
      I started calling my parents on a daily basis to help me calm down. In the game I tend to conflate multiple characters into one, and the "Mom" character was more or less all of my family.
      My parents figured I must have inherited Generalized Anxiety Disorder from one of my many ancestors who suffered from it. We booked therapy and an appointment with a doctor. One thing I don't talk about much in the game is the difficulty in getting therapy. It took over a month 
      to get even an initial appointment with a therapist at my school. This was frustrating at the time, but the sad fact is that many many college students need that service. While I waited, I talked to a doctor who prescribed me an antidepressant. I had taken antidepressants in high school 
      and quickly decided to stop taking them, but the doctor assured me that these were a different class of anti depressant and should work since I'm older now. These pills may have made the situation much, much worse according to some people, but I certainly don't blame anyone for that because 
      nobody knew what was really happening to me. I began to notice subtle connections between different things that didn't really exist. I also began believing a few different delusional conspiracy theories about my own life. Most prominently at this time, I thought that professors were talking about me in 
      meetings and sending me coded messages in their emails. I believed that some of them wanted me kicked out of the university and others were fighting to keep me there. As the situation got worse, my sister decided to fly from Missouri to Utah to see me. She convinced me to quit the TA job after a days long 
      delibration process. It was very calm. We talked several times for hours and she helped me realize that I needed to make this big decision for my own health. Eventually, I told her I would quit, and she came over to give me a hug.
      I hadn't cried at this point for years, but in that moment I broke down. I cried like all of the painful events of the past few years that I had pushed down finally actually happened. My dog finally really died, my ex finally really left, and I finally really stopped hearing from my friends from home. 
      I don't know if I've ever felt something so deeply in my entire life. I physically shook as she asked what was wrong. I thought of how I could possibly explain myself. I thought about the time when she was a teenager and she interrupted my game of Call of Duty to ask for a hug. I remembered her shaking the 
      same way I was. I remembered the concern and confusion that I felt. I just told her "I really needed a hug."  It wasn't a lie, but the whole truth wasn't even clear to me at that point.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    I quit the job minutes before my sister had to catch her flight back. I actually did tell the professor that I thought his expectations were too high, 
    and that seemed to irk him. He made sure that I got paid for my time, and wished me well. Some time went by and nothing really changed. I was still just 
    as anxious, I was barely sleeping at this point, and my delusions continued to balloon. I spent more time on the phone. I would call my parents as soon
    as I thought they were awake and they would try to calm me down for hours at a time, punctuated by an hour or two between calls where I would rev myself back up
    and call back. This culminated in me having the worst panic attack of my life up to that point. I broke a rule and called my mom much later than I normally would. 
    She answered and I
