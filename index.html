  <div class="title">about me</div>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer at Missouri Farm Bureau with a passion for
    programming. I taught myself how to write C++ at age 11 and have since
    continued to work on projects that challenge me to improve.
    I have made over a dozen games, implementing a wide variety of gameplay,
    while working with a variety of differently sized teams. Through making
    games I have: won a ticket to showcase a game at GDC, won game jams,
    and seen my work featured on Markiplier's Youtube channel, PCGamer,
    and RockPaperShotgun.

    <a href="adamjwaggoner.com"><h1> Opal </h1></a>
    <p> Opal is a game engine that I have been developing since February of 2020.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of the code is written in C++. I originally wrote the renderer in OpenGL, but recently started the switch to Vulkan both to learn a new skill and to be able to support as many platforms as possible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I built a small survival mystery game with it called Snowbound, which you can read more about on the <a href="projects-games.html">projects page.</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am also building a new version of my game Retrostasis in this engine and it has come along nicely. For more details on what I have implemented go to the <a href="projects-games.html">projects page</a> and check out 'Opal', 'Snowbound', and 'Ichor'.</p>

    <p> Narative adventure game developed in two weeks for
      Adventure Jam 2016 by Josh O'Caoimh and me.

      I did the programming, including custom shaders, and a menu that could display
      the player's progress through a graph of memories.

    <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/eighteen/45396"><h1> Eighteen </h1></a>
    <p>An exploration game about growing up. I took inspiration from games like
      Journey and Flower to make a game that could transport people into another
      world.</p>
      <br>
    <p>
      I wrote all of the code for Eighteen which involved an event-driven interaction
      system, as well as a dynamic day/night/weather cycle. I made models and
      materials for the game with Blender and Maya, and worked with a musician
      friend to develop a dynamic system for layering chords on top of the
      background music as the game progressed.

    <p>A 2D puzzle platformer where players must conserve energy and remember
      how to get back to their friend.</p>
    <p>I made the original prototype of Retrostasis solo in 72 hours for
      Gamejolt's GDC jam. Afterwards I developed the game further with a team
      of 4 over the course of a summer.</p>
    <p>I wrote a custom SAT
      collision detection and resolution algorithm, and modified an existing ray-casting
      based 2D lighting system to include efficient collision detection.</p>
