<div class="title">about me</div>
<p>I'm a SLC based game programmer and student of Computer Science.</p>
<p>
  Game programming has been a driving force in my life. Over the past 8 years I've
  worked on dozens of projects with a huge variety of teammates. I enjoy empowering
  passionate teams to make the best possible games, and pushing myself to always
  contribute everything I can.

    <h1> Eighteen </h1>
    <p>An exploration game about growing up. I took inspiration from games like
      Journey and Flower to try and make something that could transport people into
      another world.</p>
      <br>
    <p>I wrote all of the code for Eighteen which involved an event-driven interaction
      system, as well as a dynamic day/night/weather cycle. I made models and
      materials for the game with Blender and Maya, and worked with a musician
      friend to develop a dynamic system for layering chords on top of the
      background music as the game progressed.</p>

    <h1> Torpor </h1>
    <p> Explore the story of a soldier, his family, and the man that killed him
      through the things that shaped their lives. Made in two weeks for
      Adventure Jam 2016 by Josh O'Caoimh and me. I did the programming, including
      custom shaders, and a menu that could display the player's progress through
      the memory graph.

    <h1> Retrostasis </h1>
    <p>A 2D puzzle platformer where players must conserve energy and remember
      how to get back to their friend.</p>
    <p>I made the original prototype of Retrostasis solo in 72 hours for
      Gamejolt's GDC jam. Afterwards I developed the game further with a team
      of 4 over the course of a summer.</p>
    <p>I wrote a custom physics system for better player control. This involved a custom SAT
      collision detection and resolution algorithm. I also modified an existing ray-casting
      based 2D lighting system to include efficient collision detection.</p>
    <br>
    <p>- One of 5 winners out of 120 entries in GDC jam 2016.</p>
    <p>- Showcased at Gamejolt's GDC booth in 2016.</p>

    <h1> Please Respond, Colony One </h1>
    <p>Paint landscapes and discover the memories of the last survivor of the first martian colony.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm programming all of the core gameplay systems, shaders, and UI.
       I'm especially proud of an animated post-process shader that implements
       the Kuwahara filter on the GPU to render a stylized painting to a
       temporary render target.</p>
    <br>
    <p> PRCO is currently being developed by Josh O'Caoimh and me. Coming soon!</p>

    <h1> Attractor </h1>
    <p>A bullet-hell game with a twist. Players can't shoot enemies, instead
      they must use the magnetic attraction of their cargo to slingshot bullets
      into enemies.</p>
      <br>
    <p>I am currently working on Attractor with a group of friends from
      the U of U's Gamecraft club. We hope to ship the game either through
      Steam or the Android marketplace within the next year or so.</p>

    <h1> Castle Splash! </h1>
    <p>Dig sand and build barricades to fortify your sand castle against the
    tide! Made with a team of 9 at the University of Utah's Global
    Game Jam location. I mainly worked as a technical artist, focusing on gamefeel,
    particles and image effects.</p>
<br><br>
    <p>I worked closely with the art team to make sure that the game stayed up
    to date with the latest assets, as well as working with the other programmers.
    to implement core features and design the overarching UML of the game.</p>
