    <button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/retrostasis-strip.jpg"><h1>Retrostasis</h1><h2>Feb '16</h2><h2>4th Place, Gamejolt GDC Jam</h2> </button>
    <div class="panel">
      
      <p>An open-world 2D platformer where jumping is a resource. I made Retrostasis in 72 hours for Gamejolt's GDC jam. Everything but the music was done by me, the music was done by <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/sync-official">SYNC</a>. Retrostasis won fourth place out of 128 games, and I got to show it at Gamejolt's booth at GDC 2016. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZS5tWbeY0">timelapse of the whole jam</a>.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p> A short narrative game where you find important objects that link together different scenes which piece together a story. Made in two weeks for Adventure Jam 2016 by Josh O'Caoimh and me. I did the programming, Josh did the art, and we collaborated on everything else. It was written about on <a href="http://www.alphabetagamer.com/torpor-game-jam-build-download/">Alpha Beta Gamer</a>, <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week/">PCGamer</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/04/best-free-games-of-the-week-22/">RockPaperShotgun</a>.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>A game where you catch nuts that fall from the sky. Made in one night for a gamejam put on by the Gamecraft club at the University of Utah.  </p>
      <p>As lead programmer, I worked with and organized a team of 6 other programmers, many of whom had little Unity experience. I also worked closely with the producer, artists, and audio engineers to ensure that everyone was always on the same page. We started brainstorming for the game at 7p.m., had a functioning prototype at midnight, and finished the game around two in the morning.</p>

<button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/orpheus-strip.jpg"><h1>Orpheus</h1><h2>Role: Programmer (Team of 3)</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I joined a team of two to work on a procedurally generated action platformer in 48 hours. I was tasked with programming the level generator. My solution was to use the "Spelunky" method of designing a bunch of rooms in a text editor, and then writing a C# script in Unity to string them together in a way that created a snake-like path to the level's exit. <a href = "http://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/"> Based on this post.</a></p>
