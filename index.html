<img src="img/bwportrait.jpg" class="floatLeft"> <div class="title">about me</div>
<p>I am a Utah based game programmer, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on game development at the University of Utah, the #1 ranked game school in the US.</p>
<p>I taught myself to write Hello world in C++ when I was 12, and have been obsessed ever since. I'm passionate about games as a creative outlet, and my goal has always been to contribute as much as I can to the development of unique and innovative games.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/torpor-strip.jpg"><h1>Torpor</h1><h2><p>Programmer, Designer (Team of 2)</p></h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> A short narrative game where you find important objects that link together different scenes and piece together a story. Made in two weeks for Adventure Jam 2016 by Josh O'Caoimh and me. I did the programming, Josh did the art, and we collaborated on everything else. It was written about on <a href="http://www.alphabetagamer.com/torpor-game-jam-build-download/">Alpha Beta Gamer</a>, <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week/">PCGamer</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/04/best-free-games-of-the-week-22/">RockPaperShotgun</a>.

      <p/><em>"For a game that was created in just 2 weeks, Torpor boasts an exciting and rich gameplay experience that will leave the player questioning how the events connect to one another..."</em> - Alpha Beta Gamer</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>A game where you catch nuts that fall from the sky. Made in one night for a gamejam put on by the Gamecraft club at the University of Utah.  </p>
      <p>As lead programmer, I worked with and organized a team of 6 other programmers, many of whom had little Unity experience. I also worked closely with the producer, artists, and audio engineers to ensure that everyone was always on the same page. We started brainstorming for the game at 7p.m., had a functioning prototype at midnight, and finished the game around two in the morning.</p>

<!--<button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/orpheus-strip.jpg"><h1>Orpheus</h1><h2>Role: Programmer (Team of 3)</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I joined a team of two to work on a procedurally generated action platformer in 48 hours. I was tasked with programming the level generator. My solution was to use the "Spelunky" method of designing a bunch of rooms in a text editor, and then writing a C# script in Unity to string them together in a way that created a snake-like path to the level's exit. <a href = "http://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/"> Based on this post.</a></p>
