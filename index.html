    <button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/torpor-strip.jpg"><h1>Torpor</h1><h2>May '16</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Explore the story of a soldier, his family, and the man that killed him through the objects that shaped their lives. Torpor is a short narrative game where you find important objects that link together different scenes which piece together a story. It was made in two weeks for Adventure Jam 2016 by Josh O'Caoimh and me. I did the programming, Josh did the art, and we collaborated on everything else. It was written about on <a href="http://www.alphabetagamer.com/torpor-game-jam-build-download/">Alpha Beta Gamer</a>, <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week/">PCGamer</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/04/best-free-games-of-the-week-22/">RockPaperShotgun</a>.  

      <p/><em>"For a game that was created in just 2 weeks, Torpor boasts an exciting and rich gameplay experience that will leave the player questioning how the events connect to one another..."</em> - Alpha Beta Gamer</p>

    <button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/retrostasis-strip.jpg"><h1>Retrostasis</h1><h2>Feb. '16</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>An open-world 2D platformer where jumping is a resource. I made Retrostasis in 72 hours for Gamejolt's GDC jam. Everything but the music was done by me, the music was done by <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/sync-official">SYNC</a>. Retrostasis won fourth place out of 128 games, and I got to show it at Gamejolt's booth at GDC 2016. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZS5tWbeY0">timelapse of the whole jam</a>.</p>

      <p>As part of a not-yet-released project, I wrote a postproccess shader in cg that makes a scene look painted. The effect is achieved with an implementation of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwahara_filter">Kuwahara filter.</a> </p>

<button class="accordion"><img class="TextWrap" src="img/orpheus-strip.jpg"><h1>Dungeon Generator</h1><h2>Jun. '15</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I joined a team of two to work on a procedurally generated action platformer in 48 hours. I was tasked with programming the level generator. My solution was to use the "Spelunky" method of designing a bunch of rooms in a text editor, and then writing a C# script in Unity to string them together in a way that created a snake-like path to the level's exit. <a href = "http://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/"> Based on this post.</a></p>
